Reporting bugs is very important so that we can keep Stendhal running smoothly. So, if a bug is worth asking /support or a developer about, it is worth submitting a bug report on.

<p>We have made this page to help you with the process of submitting a bug report, because we find them so helpful.

<p> You can submit a new report <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&amp;group_id=1111&amp;atid=101111">here</a>, or browse the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=1111&amp;atid=101111">bugs tracker</a>, you may wish to select Category <b>Open</b> and then click <b>Filter</b> if you only wish to see the Open bug reports.



<p>We are more than happy to close reports that are not really bugs, and would prefer you to submit a bug report and us close it, than not submit it and we never find out about it. Having said that, before submitting a bug you should scan over the previously posted bugs summaries so that you don't report an already known bug.

<?php startBox("<h2>Making a Report</h2>"); ?>

If you need any help on submitting a bug report feel free to come and ask the developers and contributors at the
<?php echo '<a href="'.rewriteURL('/development/chat.html').'">'?>
irc channel #arianne</a>, you can just ask the question as the channel is logged, then wait for an answer incase noone was physically present when you arrived.
<p>If there are multiple bugs to report, please open a report for each.</p>
<ul>
<li> Summary - This is the title of the bug report. Choose a meaningful and brief sentence.
